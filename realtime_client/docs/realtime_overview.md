Realtime API

Beta

====================

Build low-latency, multi-modal experiences with the Realtime API.

The OpenAI Realtime API enables you to build low-latency, multi-modal conversational experiences with [expressive voice-enabled models](/docs/models#gpt-4o-realtime). These models support realtime text and audio inputs and outputs, voice activation detection, function calling, and much more.

The Realtime API uses GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models with additional capabilities to support realtime interactions. The most recent model snapshots for each can be referenced by:

*   `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`
*   `gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview-2024-12-17`

Dated model snapshot IDs and more information can be found on the [models page here](/docs/models#gpt-4o-realtime).

Get started with the Realtime API
---------------------------------

Learn to connect to the Realtime API using either WebRTC (ideal for client-side applications) or WebSockets (great for server-to-server applications). Once you connect to the Realtime API, learn how to use client and server events to build your application.

[

Connect to the Realtime API using WebRTC

To interact with Realtime models in web browsers or client-side applications, we recommend connecting via WebRTC. Learn how in this guide!

Connect to the Realtime API using WebSockets

In server-to-server applications, you can connect to the Realtime API over WebSocket as well. Learn how in this guide!

Realtime model capabilities

Learn to use the Realtime API's evented interface to build applications using Realtime models. Learn to manage the Realtime session, add audio to model conversations, send text generation requests to the model, and make function calls to extend the capabilities of the model.
